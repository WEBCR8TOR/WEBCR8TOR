### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a new software developer and have been learning CSS, HTML, and Javascript through freecodecamp.org for a couple of years until I found Tech Elevator. Now I'm starting a cohort in July to learn Java and I couldn't be more excited.

pronouns: He/Him

Fun fact: I worked in global logistics and freight forwarding for almost a decade before starting my path to become a software developer.
